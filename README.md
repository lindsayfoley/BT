Hello!

Thanks for inviting me to the second stage.

I used Create React App (CRA) for this project, opted for TypeScript over JS (ðŸ’› the compile-time validation!) and Jest and Enzyme for my unit tests.

I was planning on hosting this on Netlify but sadly the News API in the brief is only free for development so youâ€™ll have to run this locally (npm start) to play around.

There are a few things Iâ€™ve done in this project that I wouldnâ€™t do in the real world, however chose to so in the interest of time:
- Security - I would never commit my env file with my API key ðŸ˜„ but I did this so youâ€™ll have it handy when you run the app
- Form validation - I would have opted for something like Formik to save myself the pain of trying to cater for a host of different scenarios! However as this was a test I thought it would be more valuable for me to add custom validation and hopefully Iâ€™ve covered the main cases/areas of concern
- Error messaging - I would amend this so the content doesnâ€™t shuffle when it appears/disappears 
- CSS - I would have done more, possibly used styled components or at the very least SCSS and added fallback/polyfills for legacy browses to ensure cross-browser compatibility 

Hope this summary helps ðŸ‘‹
